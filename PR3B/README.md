## Configuration

### Customizable Parameters

Edit the following variables in `main.py`:

```python
# Camera Configuration
CAMERA_WIDTH = 800          # Camera resolution width
CAMERA_HEIGHT = 600         # Camera resolution height
CAMERA_FORMAT = "RGB888"    # Color format

# Detection Parameters
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.01  # Minimum confidence (1%)
MODEL_PATH = "model/yolov11_seg_trash.pt"  # Model location

# Visual Configuration
MASK_ALPHA = 0.4            # Mask transparency (0.0-1.0)
BACKGROUND_ALPHA = 0.6      # Background blend factor
FONT_SCALE = 0.5            # Text size
FONT_THICKNESS = 2          # Text thickness
BOX_THICKNESS = 2           # Bounding box thickness

# Color Palette
COLORS = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255), (255, 255, 0), 
          (255, 0, 255), (0, 255, 255), (128, 0, 128), (255, 165, 0),

```

### Performance Tuning

```python
# Segmentation optimization
MASK_THRESHOLD = 0.5        # Mask binarization threshold
VERBOSE_MODE = False        # Disable verbose output for speed

# Camera optimization for better performance
picam2.preview_configuration.main.size = (640, 480)  # Lower resolution
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera Not Working**
```bash
# Check camera detection
vcgencmd get_camera
# Should return "supported=1 detected=1"

# Test camera functionality
libcamera-hello --timeout 5000
```

**Model Loading Errors**
- Verify model file exists in `model/yolov11_seg_trash.pt`
- Check model file integrity (not corrupted)
- Ensure sufficient RAM available (segmentation requires more memory)
- Try restarting the system

**Segmentation Performance Issues**
- Reduce camera resolution for better frame rate
- Increase confidence threshold to reduce false positives
- Check lighting conditions for optimal detection
- Ensure trash objects are clearly visible

**Memory Issues**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -h

# Increase swap space for segmentation
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
# Set CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
sudo dphys-swapfile setup
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
```

**Mask Overlay Problems**
```python
# Adjust mask transparency
MASK_ALPHA = 0.3  # Make masks more transparent
BACKGROUND_ALPHA = 0.7  # Adjust background blending
```

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Update packages
sudo apt update
pip install --upgrade ultralytics
pip install --upgrade opencv-python
pip install --upgrade numpy
```

### Debug Mode

Add debug information for troubleshooting:

```python
# Add after model loading
print(f"Model classes: {model.names}")
print(f"Model type: segmentation" if hasattr(model.model[-1], 'nm') else "detection")

# Add in segmentation loop
print(f"Masks found: {len(masks) if masks is not None else 0}")
print(f"Confidence: {conf:.3f}, Class: {class_name}")
```

### Hardware Testing

**Test Individual Components:**

```bash
# Test camera with different resolutions
libcamera-still -o test_800x600.jpg --width 800 --height 600

# Monitor system resources during operation
htop

# Check GPU memory usage (if available)
vcgencmd measure_temp
vcgencmd get_mem gpu
```
