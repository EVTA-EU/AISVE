# AISVE - AI & Sustainability in VET Education

## Overview

AISVE (AI & Sustainability in VET Education) is part of a comprehensive 35-month European project (September 2023 - July 2026) that addresses the urgent need to integrate AI education in Vocational Education and Training (VET). This repository contains a collection of technological projects developed to bridge the skills gap and prepare the workforce for AI-driven changes while promoting sustainable solutions.

The project is driven by the recognition that AI is a transformative force in modern society, yet many students finishing compulsory education lack understanding of its workings, potential opportunities, and necessary precautions. In a digitally advancing Europe, integrating AI education is both urgent and essential.

This collection of projects ranges from basic sensor implementations to advanced AI-powered solutions, all designed to raise awareness about environmental issues and provide practical solutions for environmental monitoring and automation through hands-on learning experiences.
